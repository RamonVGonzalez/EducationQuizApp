# EducationQuizApp
This Project is an education quiz app which asks Computer related questions.
It has a section for filling out a candidate's personal information as well as the Quiz itself which contains seven questions.
The Quiz app has been optimized for small screens so that the candidate does not need to enable screen rotation to view the options clearly.
It also has an invisible text view that appears after you click the "Submit" button which displays your personal information as well as your score in percentage.
This is in addition to the toast text which is the pre-requisite output display.
Every coding task is optimized for readability and easy understanding.
The display is also well styled for aesthetical purposes.
Well, I will delay you no further,see for yourself.
Thanks to Udacity for making this possible.
